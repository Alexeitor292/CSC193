        <h1>Welcome to My Homelab</h1>

        <p>
            I've been slowly building out my own <strong>homelab</strong> so I can learn more about
            <strong>servers</strong>, <strong>virtualization</strong>, and <strong>networking</strong>.
            It all started with a single used server and has grown into a small rack with Proxmox,
            VLANs, and a dedicated machine for running <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">virtual machines</a>.
            Working on this setup has helped me understand how real data centers work and has made
            me much more confident tinkering with hardware and operating systems.
        </p>

        <p>This is my pride and joy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dual Socket EPYC 7502 Server</li>
            <li>128GB ECC RAM</li>
            <li>RTX 5090 GPU for AI model hosting and training</li>
            <li>Multiple NVMe drives in RAID for speed and redundancy</li>
            <li>Connected to a 10Gbps network switch</li>
        </ul>
